# Firebase-Train-Scheduler

Hi, everyone! Here is my Train Scheduler project that uses Firebase to store real time data. Input your Train Name, destination, 
frequency, and it'll return the current time, next avaiable train, and how many minutes left. Play around with it and have fun! Thanks
for stopping by!
